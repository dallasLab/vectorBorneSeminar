## Course Overview

This course is a graduate seminar focused on vector-borne disease, largely considering viral pathogens vectored by mosquitos. The plan below is subject to change and dependent on the interests of those enrolled in the course. However, the main goal is to introduce students to the wide breadth of things which influence vector-borne disease across host individuals, communities, and entire landscapes. 



\bigskip





## Course Goals

* Develop an understanding of terms surrounding vector-borne disease and disease in general (e.g., vectorial capacity)
* Acknowledge the different scales and filters of viral emergence (spatial resolution and scale) and infection (from individual to population)
* Gain experience reading and synthesizing primary literature
* Be able to explore and think critically about the congruence between models and reality

## Respect people

Discussion classes tend to self-select those that are more forthcoming with their opinions. We all come from different backgrounds, and we all have useful contributions to discussion. I will not tolerate any form of hateful speech, most notably any disrespect when it comes to gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. I will do my best to use breakout groups and get everyone to feel as though they can contribute to an open discussion, but feel free to email me (tadallas@lsu.edu) or Rebecca (rcarri1@lsu.edu) with ideas or suggestions of how we could do this better.

## Disability services

My goal is to help you learn. Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability to perform in class can reach out to the LSU Disability Services staff. 

More information on registering a disability is available at [LSU Disability Services](https://www.lsu.edu/disability/), located at 124 Johnston Hall. Contact the Center by telephone at 225-578-5919 or via email at `disability@lsu.edu`.

## Grading

Your grade is based largley on your participation in discussion, as well as your leadership of 2-3 weeks of discussion. Each week will be led by two discussion leaders, who will facilitate the exploration of the material and provide context and examples where appropriate.

# Schedule

*doi stands for digital object identifier, and is a way to more permanantly reference materials instead of links etc. Typing that into Google will take you right to the paper. If prefixed with https://doi.org/, it will take you directly to the paper. If you don't have access to the paper, use Sci-hub. It's fantastic.
